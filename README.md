<h1>Easy Web-Site Design Presenter</h1>
<p>
This is a small side project meant to ease the process of creating a web-site design presentation for the client.
</p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>
I design websites. Usually when I present the design to a client, I upload a .html to the server and send the client a link so he can see the design straight in the browser. This way of presenting a web site design is far better then sending a collection of pics (or worst a .pdf), also helps the client to accept the design faster by creating a nice experience, feels that the site is almost Live.
</p>
<p>
After a while the process of editing html-s and building navigation for each project becames a bit annoying, so here is a tool that will make the presentation process much faster.
</p>



<h2>Upload the presenter to a folder on your server & Drag and Drop images to images folder, that’s It! Really thats’ it :-)</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
Drop images to images->folder. Sections will be built automatically by reading the images(Naming, Height, Image Description -> TITLE) from the images folder! Each image will generate a separate Section (ex. Home-page-design, Category-page-design, Single-page-design), a navigation is generated with links to each section for easy access to all the separate page designs.

Navigation item title will be generated from image Properties -> Details -> Title:, Navigation item order based on naming order (ABC / 123)
<br/>
------------------------------
<br/>
Images (navigation) will be listed by naming order:
<br/>
1-image.jpg<br/>
2-image.jpg<br/>
3-image.jpg<br/>
<br/>
