Just Drag and Drop images to images->folder. Sections will be built automatically by reading the images(Naming, Height, EXIF -> TITLE) from the images folder! Each image will generate a separate Section (ex. Home-page-design, Category-page-design, Single-page-design), a navigation is generated with links to each section for easy access to all the separate page designs.

Navigation item title will be generated from image EXIF -> Title, Navigation item order based on naming order (ABC / 123)

------------------------------
Images (navigation) will be listed by naming order:

1-image.jpg
2-image.jpg
3-image.jpg
------------------------------

Navigation title is image EXIF title. Right click image and edit EXIF title!
